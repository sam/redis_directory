====== Redis::Directory

Redis::Directory assumes a Redis installation running on a default
port and database 0 that will contain connection information for various
other Redis databases. For example, if you were using a Redis database to
store the content of cached pages, and this was running on a cluster of
two Redis instances, with multiple applications connecting partitioned by
database, then your connection might look like this:

  require "redis"
  require "redis/distributed"

  # The ACME Corp database is #27
  cache = Redis::Distributed.new "redis://redis.example:4400/27", "redis://redis.example:4401/27"

Redis::Directory uses a centralized Redis database to store the
connection information so you don't have to remember "magic numbers" for
each client/database mapping, and can easily update port-numbers/hostnames,
cluster-members as necessary. The same connection with
Redis::Directory would look like this:

  require "redis_directory"
  
  cache = Redis::Directory.new("redis.example").connect("cache", "acme")
